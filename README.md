## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries

### Continued development

I really liked being able to do this challenge. Experience things you've been wondering about for a long time like animations and transitions.
I still have a lot to learn about responsiveness. But I will continue to learn very carefully.
